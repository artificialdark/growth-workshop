"""
Calculate the lift curves

We will take our first data set and use it as a baseline.

We will assume that each user gained was the result of a marketing campaign on each social network.

Our goal here is to calculate the lift curve such that when we run a second campaign, we can see

either improvements or not with respect to the delta. The positive response rate will be marked

by the number of buy actions within the dataset, from there we can calculate a conversion rate.

After wards, we will run similar calculations to visualize a lift curve.

Multiply the results by a cost benefit matrix.

Need to add columns for features;

bought in last 30 days
was_active (shared,liked,..) last 30,60,90

Possibly add: mean delivery time for each user (add variance)


For the final list, it's a moving threshold for each instance.
